  "Grape Black rot": "Plant resistant or tolerant varieties (e.g., Norton, Concord hybrids), ensure excellent canopy airflow through shoot thinning and leaf removal, remove mummies and infected clusters in winter, apply protective fungicide (mancozeb, captan, myclobutanil) from immediate pre-bloom through 4–5 weeks after bloom, bury or remove pruned wood.",
  "Grape Esca Black Measles": "Use certified clean planting material, avoid large pruning wounds in winter (prune late when spores are low), double-pruning or delayed pruning technique, paint large cuts with fungicidal paste or Bordeaux mixture, remove and burn severely affected vines, no curative chemical control available – prevention is key.",
  "Grape Leaf blight Isariopsis Leaf Spot": "Improve air circulation by canopy management (shoot positioning, leaf removal in fruit zone), avoid overhead irrigation, apply mancozeb or copper-based fungicide from pre-bloom to veraison on 10–14 day schedule in wet seasons, clean up and destroy fallen leaves in autumn.",
  "Grape healthy": "Maintain open canopy with proper trellising, shoot thinning and leaf removal, balanced nutrition (avoid excess nitrogen), use drip irrigation, apply early-season protective fungicides only if high disease pressure in region, remove all mummies and pruned wood from vineyard, regular scouting from bud-break onward."
