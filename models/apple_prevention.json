    "Apple scab": "Choose resistant varieties (e.g., Liberty, Enterprise), plant in full sun with good air circulation, apply preventive fungicides (captan, myclobutanil) from green tip to petal fall, rake and destroy fallen leaves in autumn.",
    "Apple Black rot": "Plant resistant cultivars, ensure good spacing and pruning for air circulation, remove mummies and cankers during winter pruning, apply preventive fungicides (captan, thiophanate-methyl) from silver tip through summer.",
    "Apple Cedar apple rust": "Plant resistant apple varieties (e.g., Freedom, William’s Pride), remove or avoid planting alternate hosts (Eastern red cedar/juniper) within 500–1000 ft, apply preventive fungicides (myclobutanil, propiconazole) from tight cluster to petal fall.",
    "Apple Powdery mildew": "Select resistant varieties (e.g., Freedom, Jonafree), prune trees for open canopy and good airflow, avoid excess nitrogen fertilization, apply sulfur or potassium bicarbonate sprays preventively in spring.",
    "Apple Fire blight": "Plant resistant cultivars (e.g., Enterprise, Freedom), avoid heavy nitrogen fertilization and over-irrigation, prune during dormant season only, apply copper sprays at green tip and again at 10–20% bloom as a preventive measure.",
    "Apple healthy": "Continue good cultural practices: proper pruning, balanced fertilization, resistant varieties, and regular monitoring to maintain plant health."
