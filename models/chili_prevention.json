    "Chili healthy": "Use resistant/tolerant varieties, maintain balanced fertilization (avoid excess nitrogen), ensure good spacing and airflow, irrigate at soil level, scout regularly, remove weeds and crop debris.",
    "Chili leaf curl": "Plant virus-resistant varieties (e.g., Pusa Jwala R, Arka Khyati), install 40–60 mesh insect nets in nursery and field, apply seedling root dip with imidacloprid or thiamethoxam, spray neem oil + sticky yellow traps to control whitefly vector, rogue and burn curled plants immediately.",
    "Chili leaf spot": "Choose resistant varieties, avoid overhead irrigation, apply copper-based fungicide (copper oxychloride) or mancozeb preventively every 10–14 days during humid weather, remove and destroy infected leaves, practice 2-year crop rotation.",
    "Chili whitefly": "Use yellow sticky traps at 15–20 per acre, spray neem oil 2–3 times at weekly intervals, release natural enemies (Encarsia, Eretmocerus), apply imidacloprid or acetamiprid only when threshold reached, grow marigold as trap crop on borders.",
    "Chili yellowish": "Test soil for nutrient deficiency, correct with balanced NPK + micronutrients (especially Mg, Fe, Zn), avoid water stress, check for root rot or virus (leaf curl/mosaic), apply foliar spray of 0.5% urea + micronutrient mixture if deficiency confirmed."
