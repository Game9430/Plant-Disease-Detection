    "Potato Early blight": "Plant certified disease-free seed potatoes, choose resistant varieties (e.g., Kennebec, Defender), ensure good spacing (12–15 inches) for air circulation, avoid overhead irrigation, apply preventive fungicides (chlorothalonil, mancozeb) starting when plants are 6–8 inches tall, rotate crops (3–4 years), destroy volunteer potatoes and infected debris.",
    "Potato Late blight": "Use certified seed only, plant resistant/tolerant varieties (e.g., Elba, Rosa, Defender), hill plants well to cover tubers, avoid overhead watering, scout regularly, apply preventive fungicides (mancozeb, chlorothalonil) or copper-based products on a 7–10 day schedule starting at row closure, destroy cull piles and volunteers immediately, practice 3–4 year crop rotation.",
    "Potato healthy": "Plant is healthy. Continue best practices: certified seed, resistant varieties, proper spacing, balanced fertilization, avoid excess nitrogen, monitor regularly.",

    "potato crop": "For general potato health: always use certified seed, select varieties suited to your region, maintain 3–4 year rotation, ensure good drainage and spacing, avoid over-fertilization with nitrogen, use drip irrigation when possible, remove all plant debris after harvest.",
    "potato hollow heart": "Prevent by maintaining even soil moisture (avoid alternating drought and heavy watering), avoid wide fluctuations in temperature, do not over-fertilize with nitrogen, plant at proper depth and spacing, choose varieties less prone to the disorder in your area."
