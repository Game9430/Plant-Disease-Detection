  "Peach healthy": "Plant resistant/tolerant cultivars (e.g., Contender, Redhaven, Encore), ensure full sun and excellent airflow with proper spacing and annual pruning, avoid overhead irrigation, apply copper sprays at leaf fall and again at bud swell, maintain balanced nutrition (avoid excess nitrogen), clean up fallen leaves and fruit.",
  "Peach bacterial spot": "Use resistant varieties whenever possible, spray copper (fixed copper or copper + mancozeb) at dormant, bud swell, and petal fall stages, continue oxytetracycline or copper sprays every 7–10 days during wet spring weather until shuck split, thin fruit heavily for better air circulation, avoid working in orchard when foliage is wet."
