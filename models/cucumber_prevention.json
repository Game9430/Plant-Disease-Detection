  "Cucumber diseased": "Remove and destroy infected leaves/fruit immediately, avoid overhead watering, improve air circulation with wider spacing and trellising, apply preventive fungicide (chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper) every 7–10 days during wet weather, disinfect tools, rotate crops 2–3 years.",
  "Cucumber healthy": "Choose resistant varieties (e.g., Marketmore 76, Diva), use drip irrigation or water at base, trellis vines for better airflow, mulch to prevent soil splash, apply preventive copper or biofungicide sprays from flowering, remove old fruit and leaves, practice 2-year rotation with non-cucurbits."
