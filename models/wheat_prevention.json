  "Wheat Brown Rust": "Grow resistant/tolerant varieties (e.g., HD2967, PBW550, DBW88), avoid excess nitrogen, apply balanced NPK with adequate potash, seed treatment with vitavax or tebuconazole, foliar spray of propiconazole 0.1% or tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin at first sign of pustules (GS 30–45), early sowing in rust-prone areas.",
  "Wheat Healthy": "Continue using resistant varieties, balanced fertilization (120:60:40 NPK + Zn), timely sowing (before last week of November in northern India), proper seed rate and spacing, regular field scouting from tillering stage, avoid late nitrogen top-dressing, remove volunteer plants and alternate hosts.",
  "Wheat Yellow Rust": "Plant highly resistant varieties (e.g., HD3171, PBW757, DBW187), very early sowing (first fortnight of October in hills, early November in plains), seed treatment with triadimenol, monitor weather (cool + moisture), prophylactic spray of propiconazole 0.1% at GS 25–30 if forecast favorable, rogue infected plants immediately.",
  "Wheat septoria": "Use resistant/tolerant varieties (e.g., HD3086, WH1105), rotate with non-cereal crops, deep plow stubble, avoid dense canopy by proper seed rate, apply azoxystrobin + propiconazole or tebuconazole + prothioconazole at flag-leaf stage (GS 39) in high-pressure areas, ensure potassium and micronutrient sufficiency."
