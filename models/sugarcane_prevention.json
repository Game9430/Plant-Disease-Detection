  "Strawberry Leaf scorch": "Remove and destroy infected leaves/plants immediately, avoid overhead irrigation, improve airflow by wider row spacing (90–120 cm) and thinning runners, plant certified disease-free runners, apply preventive fungicide (captan, thiram, or switch) from new growth in spring every 10–14 days during wet weather, mulch with straw to reduce soil splash.",
  "Strawberry healthy": "Plant only certified disease-free runners, renovate beds annually after harvest (mow leaves, narrow rows, fertilize), use drip irrigation only, maintain good spacing and runner removal for airflow, apply preventive fungicide (captan or myclobutanil) early spring and after renovation if history of scorch exists, mulch heavily with clean straw, rotate fields every 3–4 years."
